An interesting application for animation is using pose-animator.
Here an example for using it.

TLDR;
- SVG for storage skeleton image and points
- Keypoints are detected from [PoseNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview)
and [FaceMesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh)
