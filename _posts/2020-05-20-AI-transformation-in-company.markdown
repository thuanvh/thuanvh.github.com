In summary:
1. Begin with feasible small AI project
2. Build internal team of AI
3. Organize AI team under CIO/CTO/CEO/CAIO
4. Combine AI knowledge person with domamin knowledge person
5. Normal company + Deelearning NOT EQUAL TO AI Company
6. Train AI knowledge
7. Create data point, data pipeline, data workflow
8. Create a workflow process of AI Engineer
