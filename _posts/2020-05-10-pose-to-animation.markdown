An interesting application for animation is using pose-animator.
Here an example for using it. 
<https://github.com/yemount/pose-animator/>

TLDR;
- SVG for storage skeleton image and points
- Keypoints are detected from [PoseNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview)
and [FaceMesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh)

It is very interesting and promising a lot of application. Hope that we could port it into mobile app.
It is worth to dive deeper.

A note on this website that it is not official support by Google. Oh of course.
