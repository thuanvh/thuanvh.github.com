Beside Viola-Jones face detection of opencv, today I see another method for fast face detection Pico. <strong>Pixel Intensity Comparison-based Object detection (pico)</strong>

<https://github.com/nenadmarkus/pico>

It is a modification of V-J targeting real-time face detection.

I make a little test on pico build with opencv4.1. [Here](https://github.com/thuanvh/pico")

Pigo is a golang of pico.
